# Corridor — a first-person crawl with a status bar, and the example that runs CLOSE TO THE
# LINE on purpose.
#
# Every other example here is comfortable: the heaviest of them uses under half the frame.
# This one is genuinely near the edge. It casts twice as many rays as examples/raycaster.rb,
# draws them into a letterboxed view with a status bar underneath, and spends most of a frame
# doing it. Build it and run `rom.profile` — how little of each frame is left over is the
# point of the example.
#
# WHAT A FRAME IS SPENT ON, and it is not what people guess. Nearly all of it is the ray
# casting: sixty rays, each marching until it meets a wall, each one a handful of table reads
# and a divide. The DRAWING is cheap by comparison — the sky and the floor are one transfer
# each, and a wall column is one fill however tall it is. If you want the frame back, cast
# fewer rays (NUM_COLS below); everything else is rounding. Cast MORE and it stops fitting:
# eighty rays does not hold a frame, and `rom.profile` shows the rate drop when you run it.
#
# `inside` IS WHY THE STATUS BAR IS FREE. The view is drawn inside a 240x128 window, so the
# thirty-two rows under it are never touched by the sky, the floor or a wall column — those
# pixels are not drawn and then covered, they are not drawn. Without it a near wall paints the
# full height of the screen and the bar goes on top, and you pay for every pixel underneath.
#
# Walk with UP / DOWN, turn with LEFT / RIGHT. Gold is scattered through the maze; step on a
# cell to take it, and the bar counts what you have. Build it:
#   ruby examples/corridor.rb
