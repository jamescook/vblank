# AN EFFECT A GAME WRITES FOR ITSELF, on nothing but what any game can use: The Minish Cap's iris,
# copied as a pack the game brings in with `uses`. The framework knows nothing about it. The pack
# gives the light the game's own shape — each row the midpoint circle of the row above, as that game
# hands its rows over — and walks it with a job a pass, the way that game counts.
#
# Measured on the real cartridge (frames from the game's own count): the closing circle is 146 at
# the end of the frame it starts, 4 less every frame to 2, then 0; centred on (120, 80). The opening
# one is 4 on the frame it starts, 4 more every frame, centred on (184, 96), and the light goes once
# it passes 150. Each size is drawn on the next picture — but the opening's first, which that game
# hands the console while the picture is drawn, so it shows on the picture of the turn it starts.
#
# Its one test holds every picture the Advance's cartridge shows to the interpreter's, so it lives
# with the cartridge's own tests and plays on the gba run alone.
