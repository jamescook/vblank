# WHAT THE BLEND UNIT IS TOLD, write by write, in a game whose light takes turns with a scene that
# mixes a layer. The console draws from whatever the register holds at that moment, and an
# interrupt can stop a pass for dozens of rows. So a pass that writes a value it means to replace
# can leave that value in force for part of a picture, and no reading taken once a frame would show
# it. Each pass has to say its last word and nothing before it.
