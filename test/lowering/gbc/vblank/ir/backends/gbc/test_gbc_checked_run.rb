# A game built as a Game Boy Color cartridge and played in the emulator does what the interpreter
# does, pass for pass (GBC::CheckedRun): the game's numbers, its lists, its buttons and its routines,
# each the way the native lowering's statements say them and the runtime in SM83 carries them out.
# Each test is a small game of its own that leans on one of those, read back where a test of the
# game would read it; a disagreement anywhere along the run fails it.
