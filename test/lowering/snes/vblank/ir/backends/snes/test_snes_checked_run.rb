# A game built as a Super Nintendo cartridge and played in bsnes does what the interpreter does,
# pass for pass (SNES::CheckedRun): the game's numbers, its lists, its buttons and its routines, each
# carried out by 65816 code and its runtime. Each test is a small game of its own that leans on one
# of those, read back where a test of the game would read it; a disagreement anywhere along the run
# fails it.
