    # The result of comparing two Values: a yes/no test the program branches on.
    # A game branches on one with `if` and joins two with `&&` and `||` (see PlainRuby).
    # Ruby lets nobody change what those mean, so the rewrite turns them into the calls
    # below: #open_branch for `if`, and & (both) and | (either) to combine tests.
    #
    # Code that the rewrite does not read must call those itself. There, a native `if
    # (x > 5)` looks right, but a Condition is *truthy* to Ruby, so its body would emit
    # unconditionally at build time with the comparison silently ignored — no error,
    # just a ROM that always runs the branch.
