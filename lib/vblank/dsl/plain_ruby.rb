    # A game block written in normal Ruby.
    #
    # A block runs once, while the game is built, to record what the game will do. Ruby lets
    # nobody change what `if`, `&&` or `x = 1` mean, so underneath they are calls that record
    # a branch, a join and a change. This reads the block's own source with Prism and writes those few
    # constructs out as calls, and runs that instead. Everything else in the block, the verbs
    # above all, is left as it was written.
    #
    # NOTHING HERE GUESSES A TYPE. Whether `if hp > 0` is a test for the game or for the build
    # cannot be read off the source, so each construct becomes a small step (PlainRuby::Steps)
    # that looks at the value as the block runs: `if console == :gbc` stays plain Ruby.
    #
    # A BRANCH'S CODE STAYS WHERE IT WAS WRITTEN, inside parentheses in a real Ruby `if`, and is
    # never moved into a block. So the locals it sets outlive it and every line keeps its
    # number, which is what makes an error name the author's own line.
