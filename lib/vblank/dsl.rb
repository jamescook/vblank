# THE THINGS A GAME HOLDS A HANDLE TO. A verb on Builder hands one of these back — a Value, a
# Sprite, a List, a Pool — and the game then talks to it. So this is the half of the surface a
# game names directly, along with the kinds of thing those handles are made of.

# the way a part of a game does. Everything above this line is what that needs.
