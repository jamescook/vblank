        # The native-`if` slip. A comparison in this DSL is a Condition object, and
        # Ruby treats any object as true, so `if x > 5` runs its body every time
        # with the comparison silently ignored — no error, just a ROM that always
        # takes the branch. A black-screen-class footgun, and Ruby gives no hook to
        # intercept a plain `if` on a truthy object.
        #
        # So unlike the other checks, this one can't detect by walking the IR: an
        # unused Condition never records a node, so there's nothing in the tree to
        # see. Detection lives in the builder instead — a Condition joins a "pending"
        # set when built and leaves it when used, so the leftovers *are* the orphans
        # (see Builder#track_condition). This check is handed that leftover set and
        # turns each into a Finding; it ignores the program because its data is the
        # pending set, not the tree. That lets it run as an ordinary check in the
        # Validator's list, no special path.
        #
        # It reports errors, not warnings: a Condition built and never branched on
        # did nothing at all, and the only way that happens is the native-`if` slip
        # — there's no legitimate cause to weigh against.
