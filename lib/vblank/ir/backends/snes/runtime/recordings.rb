          # THE GAME'S OWN RECORDINGS (`play_sample`, `stop_sample`).
          #
          # The Advance's processor adds every recording a game plays into one stream, sixteen of them
          # at most, and the interpreter does the same sums (Reference::Mixer). The S-DSP needs none of
          # that: each recording plays on a voice of its own, read from the sound unit's memory
          # (Samples.recording). Four of its voices are free beside the four the Advance's own voices
          # take, so the first four of the sixteen places play there — voice 4 for the first, 7 for the
          # fourth — and a recording in a later place is counted and not heard.
          #
          # THE COUNT IS THE INTERPRETER'S. What the game can tell of a recording — the log saying it
          # came round again, its place coming free at its end — follows where it has got to, so each
          # place keeps that as the interpreter's mixer does: how far into the recording, in whole
          # samples and 65536ths, moved on once a frame by the samples a frame reads
          # (Console::SampleClock.on_voices), read back by its loop at its end, or freed.
          #
          # Each play the game writes is a row of the table "recording_plays" (Lowering::Sound): the
          # voice's source number, pitch and volume, the recording's length, how far back it reads at
          # its end (nought for one played once), how far it moves a frame, the number of its entry in
          # the sound log ([:sample, name]) and which recording it is.
          #
          # A SONG'S RECORDED PART plays its notes in the same places (rt_recordings_note), taking one
          # by the interpreter's rule (Reference::Mixer#start_music_note): the part's own, while it
          # still sounds a note; the first free; or the place of the lowest-ranked sound ranked below
          # the song — the game's own first, of those one that plays once before one that loops, and
          # the oldest. With none, the note is not played. A rest gives the part's place back
          # (rt_recordings_note_release), and so does the tune stopping (rt_recordings_release_music).
